# ETS-Open-Data-Project_1
This project uses the Edmonton Transit System open data to create an interactive map of Edmonton. The program loads the route shapes, coordinates,
and stop coordinates from their respective text files, and then displays them on the map as per the user's input.

When the user clicks on the map, five of the closest stops are supposed to be printed in the Python shell, but as of now, this feature
doesn't completely work.
